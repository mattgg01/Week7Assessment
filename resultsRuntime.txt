Summary of Results

I'm noticing gradually as we increase the size of the array, the slower the functions become. They become much slower at large array extra large array. 
Insert overall preformed better than append. Insert scales better. This is probably because with append, using the push() method, the code under the-
hood is having to go all the way to the end of the array to insert the new numbers, and then returns the new array length. 
With insert, the code inserts the numbers at the beginning of the array, allowing the computer to save time.
